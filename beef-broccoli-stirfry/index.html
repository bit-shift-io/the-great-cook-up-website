font-semibold">Method</h2><ol class="list-decimal pl-5"><li>Slice your beef into thin pieces. I am using chuck tender. Make sure you cut against the fiber. This way, your beef will be less chewy.</li><li>Marinate it with 1 Tb of Chinese cooking wine, 2 tsp of light soy sauce, 1 tsp of cornstarch, some freshly ground pepper and 1/4 tsp of baking soda. This is what Chinese restaurants do to tenderize the beef- especially if they are using a tough cut of beef. Without baking soda, it’s gonna be a disaster.</li><li>After it is well combined. We make the sauce. 1 Tb of light soy sauce, 1 Tb of oyster sauce, 2-3 Tb of water, 2 tsp of cornstarch, some black pepper</li><li>Cut the broccoli into bite sizes. Blanch it in boiling water for 1 or 2 minutes. Don’t cover it or else the broccoli will lose its green color. Turn off the heat and put it into ice water for 3-5 minutes to stop the cooking process. Take it out and shake off the excess water. Using this technique, the broccoli will stay fresh and crunchy. </li><li>Next, fry the beef. Heat up about 1 Tb of oil. Give it a toss so the bottom is coated nicely.  </li><li>Add in the beef. Try to separate it so most of the beef touches the bottom of the wok. Let one side fry for 15-20 seconds. Use your spatula to flip it over and fry the other side for 15-20 seconds. You should also be able to smell the scent of the smoky beef. So good. Take it out and set it aside. </li><li>In the same wok, add a little bit of oil. Put in some garlic and give it a stir. Pour the sauce into the hot wok. It will start thickening quickly. Then add in the broccoli. Mix it a little bit. Add the beef back into the wok. Coat it nicely. You are done.</li></ol><div></div><h2 class="pb-1 pt-3 text-lg font-semibold">Notes</h2><ul class="list-disc pl-5"><li>Use extra water if not using broccoli</li></ul><div></div><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nzlWBw6HyQ&amp;list=WL&amp;index=17</p><div></div><p>![](./img/beef-broccoli-stirfry-1.jpg)</p></div></main></div>
