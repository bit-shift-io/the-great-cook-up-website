almond meal, caster sugar, lemon zest, almond extract, shaved almonds, diced apricot.</li><li>Stir in water 1 tsp at a time to form a thick damp paste.</li><li>Beat egg and add a little at a time to reduce consistency (should only need about half the egg).</li><li>Mix ingredients for pastry: flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, butter, almond extract, vanilla essence. Nuke for 20 seconds if needed to soften the butter. Form a dough.</li><li>Divide pastry dough, wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 1 hr (I skip this step, I think its to make it less sticky and easier to roll?).</li><li>Preheat oven to 180. I used 220 degrees in my crap oven with a heat diffuser at the bottom.</li><li>Roll out pastry dough into a rectangle. Spread almond filling over the top. Try to fold the dough over the top if you can get it thin enough.</li><li>Brush with egg. Add shaved almonds on top. Brush again with egg.</li><li>Bake for ~20 mins or till tops start craking and going golden brown.</li><li>Remove from oven, let cool for 5 min then empty onto a cooling rack.</li></ol><div></div><h2 class="pb-1 pt-3 text-lg font-semibold">Notes</h2><p>These taste best on the day after being cooked.</p><div></div><p>Tags: Dessert</p><div></div><p>Original: https://geoffsbakingblog.com/2018/03/kanos-rondos-dutch-almond-cakes/</p></div></main></div>
